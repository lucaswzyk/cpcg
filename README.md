### Lucas
report parts: 1.2, 1.4, 5, 6
* KW20 literature on FBA, installation and first tutorials for dipy, general literature on MRI / DWI / DTI
* KW21 literature review, first version of paragraphs about AD, HCP, finished paragraph about AD
* KW22/23 reading into hcp data sets, communication with data admin, result: they do not offer tractographies, appr. 10h work
* KW24 (unsuccessfully) tried to install FLS / MRTrix on my laptop, worked on re-creating tract-seg ground truth pipeline
* KW25 "ground truth" script aborted on all computers avail. to me due to lack of memory, now running on Nils' computer (32GB), preparation of slides for intermediate presentation
* KW26 clarifaction of task as stated in WhatsApp on 24.06., paragraph about ADNI, simple descriptions of how we will evaluate
* KW28 implementation in dipy, generation of data sets to compare (tractseg and binary masks from ground truth), development of measure for non-training data, description of evaluation techniques in report
* KW29 implementated in dipy, generated data for Recobundles, ran TractSeg (without tracking stage) and Recobundles
* KW30 implemented evaluation tools (dice, plots), wrote evaluation
* KW31 reviewed / restructured report, finalized intro + evaluation, wrote conclusion
